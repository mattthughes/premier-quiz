## Testing

### Solved Bugs

* Fixed the class add issue, to fix this I created a second function called hideElements and added the hide class from the css and then added the class list add class to the show instructions function which was labelled as show changing the element from display none to display block to show the instructions.
* Fixed the issue where the footer would not stick to the bottom of the page, in order to fix this I changed the values min-height and added display flex and flex direction elements, this adjusted the main content to take up all the extra space, I also added the flex-grow property to make sure this was consistent on all screen sizes, I then added the margin-top auto style to make sure the footer stayed at the bottom of the page.
- There was an issue where the background Image would show unnessary white space when clicking the instructions button. In order to fix this I adjusted the larger padding and margin values on the instrutions window, doing this along with the fixed footer bug fix solved this issue.
- Button Elements were not centering on Tablets and Desktop screen sizes in order to fix this I added the property display flex, flex-direction column to the parent element and then used the align self element on the start and instructions button, aligning them to the center which fixed this issue.
- Fixed a bug where the instructions were visible after pressing the start button while viewing the instructions, in order to fix this I added the hide instructions function to the run game function which fixed this issue.
- Solved bugs with the quiz background this was not displaying correctly because of the height vh value removed the height value to fix this issue.
- Solved issue where there was a type error regarding the keyword question stating the value was undefined and was also trying to be used before initialisation in order to fix this initalised value outside the function declaration.
- Fixed the bug regarding duplicate answers from the runGame function in order to fix this I added a reset state function which hid the next button and used a while loop to remove the first child when it was active in the while loop.
- Fixed bug with answers not being answered correctly by changing answers.iscorrect to answers.correct which ended up the questions showing correctly.
- Fixed a bug where the questions were being repeated added new function show results with the reset state function included in this function.
- Fixed score bug which was not displaying correctly on the show results page in order to fix this I changed the template literal from questions to questions.length which got the length of the array fixing this issue.
- Fixed issue regarding correct answers when loading the quiz all questions were highlighted in green, not allowing the user to answer or go to the next question in order to fix this, I changed where the function was placed and instead placed this in the select answer function, currently this function is showing the correct answers after, I will look to refactor this function to remove this element.
